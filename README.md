# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

I created this Prework Study Guide Webpage to practice using the fallowing tools:

- HTML
- CSS
- git
- JavaScript

The final website contains notes about different features of those tool divided into easy to read sections. Moreover, the website has a built-in functionality allowing the user to randomly chose the next section to review. 

By completing this project, I practised writing code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and got a basic understanding of their features and use cases. I have also begun learning how to use git and GitHub for version control and website deployment.
